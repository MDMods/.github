## How to contribute to a project
#### Did you find a bug?
* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching the issues page for the repository.
* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, open a new one. Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.
#### Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?
* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.
* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.
* Before submitting, please ensure your code follows the coding standards and practices of the project.
* Make sure your commits are clean and have a clear message.
* Ensure your PR **only contains changes relevant to the issue you are addressing**.
#### Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?
Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability of the project will generally **not** be accepted.
#### Anything else?
If you have any questions, please feel free to ask on the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/mdmc).
